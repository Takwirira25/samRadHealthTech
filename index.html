                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Medical imaging&mdash;like MRI, CT, and PET scans&mdash;is often the first critical step in diagnosing and treating cancer. These tools guide crucial decisions and shape patient care, yet many people, especially <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">in underserved regions like parts of Zimbabwe</strong>, don’t fully understand what they are or how they work. Our aim is to demystify this process and make information more accessible.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Early detection is especially critical for cancers like breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. Catching these diseases in their earliest stages can significantly improve treatment options, reduce the need for aggressive interventions, and dramatically boost survival rates. <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">This is particularly vital in Zimbabwe, where late-stage diagnoses are common due to limited access to advanced diagnostic tools and awareness.</strong></p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">At <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">samRad Health Technologies</strong>, we’re developing advanced software that helps detect tumors directly from medical images (DICOM files)&mdash;making diagnosis faster, earlier, and more accessible <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">for patients and healthcare providers in Zimbabwe</strong>. Our ultimate goal is to support timely intervention, enable emerging treatment modalities, and ultimately improve patient outcomes <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">across our nation</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Being informed can reduce fear, improve communication with your care team, and help you make confident choices about your health journey.</p>
